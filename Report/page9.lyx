Conclusion
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We designed and simulated a differential, three stage amplifier with bias
 circuitry that met the specifications and minimized power.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We learned to reduce a potentially very high dimensional problem of sizing
 a multistage circuit to a managable, lower dimensional space using assumptions
 about the relative scale of factors and simplifying design choices.
 Being more familiar with the relative scales and contributions of circuit
 parameters such as capacitances and conductances would have certainly expedited
 the design process.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
As our first circuit design project, we were tripped up by things we had
 not encountered before.
 Having not worked with differential circuits before, we did not discover
 a bug from not connecting the sources of our differential common source
 stages in our SPICE deck for days.
