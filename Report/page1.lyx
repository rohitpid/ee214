\begin_layout Plain Layout
Page 1: Outline of your design.
 How did you approach this problem? What are some of your key design choices?
 Flow charts and graphs of how the trade offs are connected provide the
 best clarity in explaining (weâ€™ll show some examples in class).
 Half of the grading (i.e.
 25 Points) is related to Design Flow, Insight and Optimization.
 The clarity of your discussion and insight you give, starting on Page 1,
 is a major factor in doing well for these 25 Points

Our project was to design a three stage amplifier as shown in figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:Schematic"

\end_inset

 that met the specifications listed in table 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "tab:Specifications."

\end_inset

.
 A common gate stage is used to buffer the input, the common source stage
 amplifies the signal and the common drain stage buffers the output.
 Additionally, we had to design a bias voltage generator and a bias current
 generator circuit to power the core circuit.
 We first designed the core circuit assuming ideal current sources and then
 we designed the biasing circuits to supply the current we needed at each
 stage of the amplifier.
 Our overall design flow is shown in figure

\begin_layout Standard
In order to simplify our design of the bias current generator circuit, we
 set the overvoltage of the bias current generator mosfets to 1V.
 This meant that we needed to create a bias voltage of 1.5V from our voltage
 generator circuit.

\begin_layout Standard
Our design flow for the core circuit is shown in figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:Core-Circuit-Flow"

\end_inset

.
 We first started with fixed technology parameters and specifications.
 Then we made some design choices such as fixing the channel length of all
 mosfets in the core circuit to 
\begin_inset Formula $1\mu m$
\end_inset

.
 We then split the circuit into 4 nodes and found equations for the time
 constant 
\begin_inset Formula $\tau$
\end_inset

 at each node.
 We combined 
\begin_inset Formula $\tau_{2}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\tau_{3}$
\end_inset

the time constants in the middle of the circuit to simplify our analysis
 and we swept 
\begin_inset Formula $I_{D1}$
\end_inset

, 
\begin_inset Formula $V_{OV1}$
\end_inset

, 
\begin_inset Formula $I_{D3}$
\end_inset

, 
\begin_inset Formula $V_{OV3}$
\end_inset

, 
\begin_inset Formula $A_{V2}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $V_{OV2}$
\end_inset

.
 From sweeping these parameters, we determined other circuit parameters
 such as the 
\begin_inset Formula $g_{m}$
\end_inset

 and the 
\begin_inset Formula $w$
\end_inset

 for each stage and 
\begin_inset Formula $I_{D3}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $V_{OVL2}$
\end_inset

.
 Using these parameters, we found
\begin_inset Formula $\tau$
\end_inset

 values and gain values that met the specifications.
 Finally, we decreased the power available to our circuit in a sweep to
 minimize power consumption.
 We found that the main trade offs occurred at the common drain stage for
 3dB bandwidth and power which was caused by the large output capacitance
 
\begin_inset Formula $C_{out}$
\end_inset

 and the main trade off between power and gain occurred at the common source
 stage.
