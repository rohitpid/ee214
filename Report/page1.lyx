\begin_layout Plain Layout
Page 1: Outline of your design.
 How did you approach this problem? What are some of your key design choices?
 Flow charts and graphs of how the trade offs are connected provide the
 best clarity in explaining (weâ€™ll show some examples in class).
 Half of the grading (i.e.
 25 Points) is related to Design Flow, Insight and Optimization.
 The clarity of your discussion and insight you give, starting on Page 1,
 is a major factor in doing well for these 25 Points

\begin_layout Standard
Our project was to design the three stage amplifier in figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

 to the specifications listed in table

.
 The common gate stage buffers the input and converts the current signal
 into a voltage signal, the common source stage amplifies the voltage signal,
 and the common drain stage buffers the output.
 Additionally, we designed a current mirror circuit and bias generator circuit.
 We first designed the core circuit assuming ideal current sources and then
 designed the biasing circuits to supply the requisite current for each
 stage of the amplifier.
 To simplify the design process, we set all channel lengths to the minimum
 length.
 This helps constrain the design space and reduces capacitances by minimizing
 the MOSFET area, and lowering capacitance increases our 3dB bandwidth.
 To simplify the NMOS-Bias circuit dimension calculations, we set the overdrive
 voltage of the NMOS-Bias circuit to 1V.
 This required 1.5V output from our bias generator circuit.

Our core circuit design flow is shown in figure

 and centers on estimating the 3dB bandwidth with ZVTC analysis.
 We found that the circuit divided into 4 nodes (i.e.
 time constants) -- two nodes between stages and nodes at the input and
 output.
 Further, we found that the input and output time constants could be analyzed
 as functions of just two free parameters each: 
\begin_inset Formula $V_{OV}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $I_{D}$
\end_inset

.
 Subsequently, the time constants between stages could also be parameterized
 by two free parameters: 
\begin_inset Formula $A_{V2}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $V_{OV2}$
\end_inset

.
 We found a steep bandwidth-power trade off at the common drain stage due
 to the large output capacitance 
\begin_inset Formula $C_{out}\sim\text{O(pF)}$
\end_inset

 and a power-gain tradeoff at the common source stage.
 In addition, it was not sufficient to minimize time constants in stage-by-stage
 as this would leave insufficient current for the last stage analyzed, so
 we swept over 
\begin_inset Formula $V_{OV1}$
\end_inset

, 
\begin_inset Formula $I_{D1}$
\end_inset

, 
\begin_inset Formula $V_{OV3}$
\end_inset

, 
\begin_inset Formula $I_{D3}$
\end_inset

, 
\begin_inset Formula $A_{V2}$
\end_inset

, and 
\begin_inset Formula $V_{OV2}$
\end_inset

 simultaneously and selected instances that met specification.
 By decreasing the total power available to our circuit and rerunning our
 analysis, we minimized power consumption.
